# Northcoders House of Games API

## Hello!

This is the back-end project that I wrote while at the Northcoders bootcamp. The endpoint guide can be found here:

https://stans-games.cyclic.app/api

Originally was hosted with Heroku but as they discontinued their free service I have migrated to using ElephantSQL and Cyclic.

## Project Summary

Creates an API allowing access to data using express request paths, using MVC.
